# CIS 4120 – HW1, Stage 4: HTML/CSS Prototype

## Project Description  

This repository contains the Stage 4 submission for **Homework 1** in CIS 4120: Human-Computer Interaction. The assignment required taking the high-fidelity prototype from earlier stages and implementing it in code as a static prototype.  

The goal was to replicate the **opening screen** of the prototype in the dimensions of a phone using only HTML and CSS. The final implementation is **extremely similar to my high-fidelity prototype for the homepage**, with consistent layouts, colors, inputs, text, and example data.  

This version is static—no interactivity or screen transitions are implemented, as the focus was on replicating the visual design and structure.
